# couchbase-demo
Versions of the Couchbase Docker images that DO NOT set /opt/couchbase/var as a VOLUME, and therefore will maintain data and configuration in the container.  These are only intended to be used for small sharable, Couchbase demos.

Select the appropriate branch based on the version you wish to use.

Built images may also be found at https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/escapedcanadian/couchbase-demo
